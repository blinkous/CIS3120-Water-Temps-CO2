## Project Purpose
The problem that we are addressing are increasing CO2 emissions. In 2018, CO2 emissions reached an all time high after being pretty steady for a few years (Harvey; Plumer). This uptick in emissions highlights the need for efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. Our goal is to help the local government lower the carbon footprint in New York by preventing excess waste through conservation. To do so, we will analyze carbon emission data and determine the best course of action to advise the local government. The local government can further advise local businesses on how best to lower their carbon footprint and also create effective and meaningful legislation to help accomplish this goal.

## Identification of Information Needs
In order to accomplish our task, we will need data for the consumption of resources in New York. Historical data for water consumption and CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, will paint an accurate picture of the current and past consumption levels of these resources. We will also need temperature data in New York over time to determine which temperatures are the worst for waste production.

## Data Sets
The first data set we will be using is CO2 Emission data for New York State from the eia.gov website which provides independent statistics and analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration. This data set will provide data on New York Carbon Dioxide Emissions from 1980 to 2016 resulting from fossil fuel consumption by various sectors (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Transportation, Electric Power etc). The next data set we will be using is water consumption of NYC from 1979 to 2017; which includes the NYC population corresponding to the year. We retrieved this data set from data.cityofnewyork.us, an open data site for the city of New York. The last data set we will be using is recorded temperatures for Central Park from 1869 to 2018, organized by months with annual average temperature. This data set was retrieved from the weather.gov website and will help us try to correlate temperature to water consumption and waste production. We will also compare water usage to historic reservoir levels in NYC and try to determine how we can lessen the need for higher reservoir levels by predicting when the most water consumption and waste will occur.
